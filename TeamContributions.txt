First Implementation of Code using Parallax Ping Sensor: David Shen 
note: code did not function properly, but gave an idea on how sensor operated.

Reworked Code: Cory Pisano, Kyle Cavorley, Andrew Weiser
note: code still did not function properly. LED indicators and oscilloscope/spectrum analyzer testing indicating
a chirp is emitted. Problem occurs in reception of echo with parallax ping sensor

Working Code: David Shen, Kyle Cavorley, Cory Pisano, Andrew Weiser
note: Too much difficulty when implementing parallax ping sensor. Figured out GPIO pins cannot send and receive signals
from a single pin. Switched to using HC-SR04 sensor. Reworked code implemented previously worked for sensor. David modified code
to fit new sensor. Added distance and centimeter calculation. Able to change sampling frequency. Added Distance indicator.
